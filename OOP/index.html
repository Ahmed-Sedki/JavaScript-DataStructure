    <pre>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of "objects", which can
        contain data and code: data in the form of fields (also known as attributes or properties), and code in the form
        of procedures (also known as methods).

        The four main principles of OOP are:

        1.Encapsulation: This is the principle that a computer program should not expose its internal
        implementation details, but instead present interfaces through which the program's operation can be controlled.
        In OOP, this is often achieved by bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into
        objects. This helps in hiding the complexity of the program and improves maintainability and modifiability.

        2.Inheritance: This principle allows the creation of hierarchical classifications. Using inheritance, an
        object can acquire some or all of the properties of another object. This allows for code reuse, reducing
        redundancy, and can also be used to add additional features to an existing class without modifying it.

        3.Polymorphism: This principle allows objects to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in
        OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. This allows the same piece of
        code to behave differently when it's operating on objects of different classes. In practice, this can be
        implemented through function overloading, operator overloading, and interface implementation.

        4.Abstraction: This principle deals with creating simple, abstract models of more complex, real-world
        entities. Abstraction allows a programmer to hide all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce
        complexity and increase efficiency. In other words, it allows for focused, efficient code by permitting the
        creation of abstract data types that can handle complex operations while hiding unnecessary details from the
        user.

        Understanding and applying these four principles are fundamental in creating well-structured object-oriented
        programs.</pre>
